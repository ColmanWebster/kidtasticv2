# Kidtasticv2 (MERN)

Project was created using MERN stack, utilizing the MVC paradigm using the following:

MongoDB : Database -> using Mongoose\
Node : Controller -> handling backend servers\
Express: Controller -> bridging communication from client and the database.\
React: View -> handling front-end client-side rendering

## Description

The internet is filled with deliquent trolls who like to post explicit and possibly violent material on Youtube.com. Kidtastic was created in order to control that scenario by allowing only handpicked videos with many the core video on-click features, disabled. As a kid friendly site the goal is to add as many videos as possible that are safe and friendly to view. Youtube is a free website that requires no payment upon watching, and KidTastic is here to utilize resources for all children who want a troll-free experience.
